2048 - Racket Edition
=====================

This is a clean-room, functional implementation in Racket of the game ![2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) 
by Gabriele Cirulli, based on 1024 by Veewo Studio, cloned from the original iOS game
![Threes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8) by Asher Vollmer - 
![development blog](http://asherv.com/threes/threemails/).

HOW TO PLAY: 
* Use your arrow keys to slide the tiles. 
* When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
* Press <space> to rotate the board.

One of the nice things about 2048 is how many creative variations have been devised. What can the Racket community do with it?
