2048 - Racket Edition
=====================

This is a clean-room, funcgtional implementation in Racket of the game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli, based on 1024 by Veewo Studio, 
and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.

HOW TO PLAY: 
* Use your arrow keys to slide the tiles. 
* When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
* Press <space> to rotate the board.

One of the nice things about 2048 is how many creative variations have been devised. What can the Racket community do with it?
